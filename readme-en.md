The emergence of ChatGPT in 2022 has sparked a global wave of AI and showcased the potential of big models to everyone. Although the popularity of ChatGPT has decreased, it is not difficult to see from the investment, research and financing situation of global enterprises in the AI field that the peak of this AI wave represented by ChatGPT and StableDiffusion has not truly appeared. When the peak of the AI wave appears, it is likely to have a profound impact on many industries and positions.

The gears of history have already begun to turn. In order to avoid becoming cannon fodder under the impact of the next wave of AI, as ordinary people, we should not only not resist new fields, but also try and layout ahead of time. In this way, when the tide strikes, you have the confidence and ability to face the waves and rise up.

This database has collected and organized a large number of AI tools, including two categories: platform directly available versions and open source private deployment, and further classified them according to application scenarios. Considering the issue of walls for inland users, a sign has also been added to indicate whether they can be directly accessed. Of course, whether you can directly connect to your current network is closely related. The network environment for this project is telecommunications broadband. Enjoy yourself here. If you could just click on a Star, thank you very much!

The content of this project is still being continuously improved. If you are interested in cryptocurrency tools, data, and other content, please move to my other project repository. If you have any other AI tools worth recommending, please feel free to leave a message.

### <span id="2">2 AI assisted programming tools</span>

AI assists technical personnel in writing programs and improves their efficiency by providing answer to questions, content search and recommendation, automatic code completion, error checking and correction, automatic code writing, and code testing. However, it is worth noting that the current AI capabilities are not sufficient to fully take over the development work of the code, and human intervention is needed to adjust the code generated by AI to achieve the expected results.

On the other hand, Synthesizer V brings the power of human voice into the equation. This free software is an artificial intelligence generator for sound to music. Synthesizer V has an extensive sound collection, with each person having their own vocal profile. As expected, the application uses the lyrics entered by the user and converts them into mature songs. There are notes on the timeline of the Synthesizer V application. This depends on users placing the lyrics they want on the appropriate notes and creating beautiful melodies. There is a great level of customization here, including changing notes, modifying lyrics, stretching them according to your length, and so on. Although the free version only has a few sounds available, it is still enough to get people started. Synthesizer V Studio<br>Pro is a paid version with a wide range of different sounds and more custom features. You only need to pay 89 in one go to get the same thing. If you want to try sound, this artificial intelligence music generator is definitely a must try tool.

However, it has also been proven to be the fastest output speed. Although users can use Melobyte's other audio tools, their AI music tools are our focus here. AI music generators offer dozens of music styles. This includes not only old-fashioned choices, but also classic symphonic styles such as Bach, Beethoven, Vivaldi, and even Chopin. Users can also choose other elements, such as speed, measure, and enter finer details by selecting instrument notes or even audio effects. Once all is completed, Melobytes outputs a downloadable MIDI file. As mentioned above, the generator is extremely fast. It rendered a song for nearly 5 minutes in just ten seconds. The quality of the output is not entirely comparable to other artificial intelligence music generators, but it is also decent enough to sample bits. Melobytes is also free to use, and you don't even need an account. free                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

You can input your melody by uploading audio files or humming into the microphone. Tone Transfer will generate music based on the recording and play it using an acoustic instrument. You can convert your AI melody into four instruments: flute, violin, trumpet, and saxophone. Please note that Tone Transfer can only generate single part melodies, so you cannot play chords, otherwise you will end up with strange noise rather than clean tones. Although the generated audio is also in the Lo Fi range, it is much better than Riffusion! Although Tone Transfer is not perfect, the performance techniques of acoustic instruments are quite realistic, making it very promising for use in Lo Fi Hip hop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Since it is a VST3 plugin that supports Windows and macOS, you can have more control over what Tone Transfer does in DAW. Another advantage of using DDSP is that it has more instruments to play. Magenta DDSP added 11 instruments including the harmonica, bassoon, and sita. Their sound is not as good as the instruments provided by Tone Transfer. For example, the sita and clarinet do not sound realistic, while brass instruments are still acceptable. Versilian Studios developer Sam Gossner stated that AI is the future of virtual instruments, as AI based music models can better reproduce the subtle differences in pitch and dynamics of acoustic instruments than sampled instruments. Currently, tools like Magenta DDSP are not perfect, but the potential of this technology is enormous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The only application that generates MIDI is called 'Generate'. It can be used to create drum loops and melodies. The results of using 'generated' can be good or bad, but when it is in good condition, the quality of music works generated by artificial intelligence can meet the standard. The 'generation' of Magenta Studio can serve as the starting point for creating melodies. I think this is an excellent way to break the creative bottleneck. The 'Temperature' parameter is crucial. The higher the "temperature", the greater the randomness of the output. The 'Continue' parameter will create variations based on the MIDI file you loaded into it, which is very impressive! All AI generated variations that have been tested are usable and can inspire, but the only problem is that it ignores the power. When you want to complete a track but feel uninspired, this is a great tool for "continuing" to create and inspire new ideas. Interpolate is the most interesting part of the suite. You load two MIDI files in it, which will generate four different MIDI melodies from the two files. It is interesting to conduct experiments by mixing two MIDIs from different schools. Drummify is the simplest of all tools, where you load a MIDI loop (drum or melody) and obtain a MIDI drum loop. The results during the testing process were quite good. Unlike 'continue', 'drummers' consider MIDI intensity, have the rhythm that drummers should have, and do not feel random. The 'Groove' tool also adds a sense of playing to the perfectly quantified MIDI drum loop. It will adjust the time and speed of the drum to create a more humane rhythm. If you are not a drummer who often performs, this is an excellent choice to add color to your music. Overall, Magenta Studio is a great tool for inspiring and generating new ideas. Unfortunately, it cannot be used as a VST3 plugin. |

It is an 8-slot sampler that uses AI to generate sampling and custom drum group details from scratch. You can use controls such as gain, force, phase, pitch, and filtering to fine tune the sound. DrumNet also includes a powerful drum sequencer with features such as note repetition, swing swing, and force. DrumNet's AI drum sound sounds similar to the timbre of electronic drums, making it very useful for synthesizing electronic drum sounds with unique variations. The free version is fully functional, but it does not allow exporting sound. You can still use it in DAW to generate and process drum groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This music generation tool called MusicGen can convert textual descriptions (such as "a popular song from the 1980s with a drum and synthesizer in the background") into approximately 12 seconds of music. Additionally, MusicGen can selectively use reference audio for "guidance", such as an existing song, in which case it will attempt to follow the description and melody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It follows a GPT style architecture similar to AudioLM and Vall-E, as well as a quantified audio representation from EnCodec. It is not a traditional TTS model, but a fully generated text to audio model that can deviate from any given script in unexpected ways. Unlike previous methods, the input text prompt is directly converted to audio without the need for intermediate phonemes. Therefore, it can be extended to any instruction outside of speech, such as music lyrics, sound effects, or other non speech sounds. |
